    <h1>Butterfly description : </h1>
    <p>A butterfly is an insect known for its strikingly colorful wings, delicate beauty, and graceful flight. Belonging to the order **Lepidoptera**, butterflies undergo a complete metamorphosis in their life cycle, which consists of four distinct stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly.

        Key features of a butterfly:
        - Wings: The most recognizable feature, butterfly wings are often vibrantly colored and patterned, covered in tiny overlapping scales that reflect light. The patterns on the wings serve purposes such as camouflage, mating, or warding off predators.
        - Body Structure: A butterfly's body is divided into three parts:
          - Head: Contains the eyes, antennae, and proboscis (a long, coiled tube used for sipping nectar from flowers).
          - Thorax: Houses the muscles that control the wings and legs. Butterflies have six legs, and in some species, the front legs are reduced and may not be used for walking.
          - Abdomen: Contains vital organs such as the reproductive and digestive systems.
        - Antennae: Long, slender appendages used for sensing their surroundings and detecting pheromones. The tips of the antennae are often clubbed.
        - Proboscis: A long, tube-like mouthpart coiled under the head, used to sip nectar from flowers.
        - Flight: Butterflies are light and agile, capable of hovering or gliding. Their flight can be erratic, helping them evade predators.
        
        Butterflies are important pollinators, and their lifecycle and migration patterns are fascinating biological phenomena. They can be found in a variety of habitats worldwide, from tropical rainforests to grasslands.</p>
