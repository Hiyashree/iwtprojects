    <h1>Here description of a cricket ball is given : </h1>
    <p>A cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used in the sport of cricket. It is traditionally red in color for Test matches and pink or white for limited-overs formats like One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20s (T20s). The ball is made of a cork core wrapped in tightly wound string, covered by a leather casing. The casing is stitched together with prominent raised seams that help bowlers achieve swing and spin.

        Key features of a cricket ball:
        - Material:The core is made of cork, layered with string, and encased in leather.
        - Color: Typically red for longer formats like Test matches, while white or pink is used for shorter formats to improve visibility under lights.
        - Weight and Size: A men's cricket ball weighs between 155.9 and 163 grams and has a circumference of 22.4 to 22.9 centimeters.
        - Seam: The ball has six rows of stitches, creating a raised seam that is used by bowlers to generate movement in the air and off the pitch.
        
        Due to its hardness, a cricket ball can cause injury if not properly handled, especially when bowled at high speeds. Over time, the ball undergoes wear and tear, with players often polishing one side to aid swing bowling.</p>
