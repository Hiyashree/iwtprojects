    <h1>Here a brief description of a cat is given : </h1>
    <p>A cat is a small, carnivorous mammal known for its agility, independence, and playful nature. Belonging to the species **Felis catus**, domestic cats are one of the most popular pets in the world. They are valued for their companionship as well as their ability to hunt pests like mice and insects.

        Key features of a cat:
        - Body Structure:
          - Size: Cats are typically medium-sized, with adult domestic cats weighing between 3.6 and 4.5 kg (8-10 pounds) and measuring about 23-25 cm (9-10 inches) in height.
          - Fur: Cats have soft, often short to medium-length fur, which comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns such as solid, tabby, calico, and tortoiseshell.
          - Tail: Cats use their long, flexible tails for balance and communication, expressing their mood through tail movement.
        - Eyes: Cats have large, expressive eyes with vertical slit-shaped pupils. They are well-adapted for seeing in low light, giving cats excellent night vision for hunting.
        - Ears: Cats have sharp hearing and can rotate their ears to detect sounds from various directions. Their ears are pointed and upright, and they can move independently.
        - Whiskers: Long, sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) help cats navigate and sense changes in their environment, especially in tight or dark spaces.
        - Claws: Cats have retractable claws that they use for climbing, hunting, and defending themselves. They often scratch surfaces to keep their claws sharp.
          
        - Behavior:
          - Cats are known for their agility and graceful movements, aided by their flexible spine and strong hind legs, which allow them to jump great distances.
          - They are generally independent creatures but can be affectionate, forming close bonds with their human companions.
          - Cats are also known for their grooming behavior, often licking their fur to clean themselves and regulate body temperature.
        
        - Diet: Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet rich in animal protein. Domesticated cats are usually fed commercial cat food, but wild or stray cats often hunt small prey such as birds, rodents, and insects.
        
        Cats are known for their distinct personalities, ranging from highly social to more solitary, and they communicate using a variety of vocalizations, such as meows, purrs, and hisses, as well as through body language.</p>
